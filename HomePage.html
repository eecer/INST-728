	<h2 style="color:tomato; font-family:garamond;"> My keto journey …</h2>
		<p style="font-size:20px">
	My name is Elif. I am originally from Turkey. I moved to the states when I was 17 years old. I enjoy going out with my friends and trying different cuisines. Up until three months ago, I did not pay attention to the signs that my body was giving to certain foods such as milk and bread.  	
	<div style="font-size:20px">The doctors told me that I have lactose intolerance, type 2 diabetes which runs in the family, IBS and the list goes on. Each specialist that I saw restricted my diet and I did not know what to eat. I was frustrated from trying different diets and not being able to stick to any one of them. </div>
<h2 style="color:tomato; font-family:garamond;">How did I start Keto?</h2> 
<p style="font-size:20px">
One day, my friend suggested me to try a diet called keto. At first, I did not pay attention to her but as I see the change in her mood and body, I looked into it. I’ve read books and articles about its benefits and decided to give it a try.
</p>
<h2 style="color:tomato; font-family:garamond;">It was easy!</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">
I stopped eating sugar, flour, rice and pasta! This time was different because I did not want to eat any sweets after lunch or dinner. It was working so I continued. I created different recipes so that I do not feel as if I am missing anything. I felt much better as I changed my eating habits and as my ketos increased!
