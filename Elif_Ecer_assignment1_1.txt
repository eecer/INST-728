Hi everyone!
My name is Elif. 

I am originally from Turkey, and I moved to the US 21 years ago.Currently I live in Rockville, Maryland. 

I am a part time Master of Information Management student and this is my second year. Currently, I am working at the Brookings Institution as a Collection Development Librarian. 
I earned my BA in Economics from Georgetown University in 2007 and since then, I was working in various positions both internationally and in the States. 
I am happier when I can help others find the information they need and I love being surrounded by books, so I decided to become a Librarian. 
Going back to school after such a long time was a challenge, but I am so happy with my decision. 

Things that keep me busy outside of work and school are my two kids, one in college studying biochemistry and the other in high school, our two cats Mittens & Cuddles, playing table tennis, hiking with my husband, and trying different recipes especially during quarantine ðŸ˜Š

List of foods I like:

Bulletproof coffee
Green tea
Egg
Cheese
Avocados
Chicken
Cauliflower
