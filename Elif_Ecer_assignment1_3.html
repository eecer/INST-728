	<h1>Hello Everyone!</h1>
	<h2>My name is Elif</h2>
	<img alt="Elif Ecer" src="UMD Day.JPG" width="85px" align="left">
	
	<p>
	I am originally from Turkey, and I moved to the US 21 years ago.Currently I live in Rockville, Maryland. I am a part time <strong>Master of Information Management </strong>student 
	and this is my second year. For more information on MIM program, please click <a href="https://ischool.umd.edu/mim">here</a>.</P>
	
	<p>Currently, I am working at the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/about-us/">Brookings Institution</a> as a Collection Development Librarian. I earned my BA in 
	Economics from Georgetown University in 2007 and since then, I was working in various positions both internationally and in the States. I am happier when I can help others 
	find the information they need and I love being surrounded by books, so I decided to become a Librarian. Going back to school after such a long time was a challenge, 
	but I am so happy with my decision. </p>
	
	<p>Things that keep me busy outside of work and school are my two kids, one in college studying biochemistry and the other in high school, our two cats Mittens & Cuddles, 
	playing table tennis, hiking with my husband, and trying different recipes especially during quarantine.<hr></p>
